## How it works
This is a MERN project. (MongoDB, Express, ReactJS, NodeJS)

### ReactJS
The Client-Side Library allows us to build highly reactive user interfaces. This Render UI with Dynamic Data, Handle User Input and communicate with Backend Server. We want to provide a "Mobile APP" -like User Experience.

### NodeJS
This Server-side Runtime allowes JavaScript on the Server-side.
It Listen to Requests and Send Responses, execute Server-side Logic and Interact with Databases and Files.
We use this as an alternative to PHP, Java, etc.

### Express
A Node Framework which simplifies writing Server-side Code and Logic.
Based on Node, offers same Functionalities, Middleware-based Funnel Requests through Functions and Includes Routing, View-rendering and Monitor.
This simplifies the usage of Node.

### MongoDB
A NoSQL Database which stores Documents in Collections.
This stores Application Data, Enforces no Data Schema or Relations and is Easily to connect to Node and Express.
